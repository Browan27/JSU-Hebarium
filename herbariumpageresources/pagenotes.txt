 from what i can see of the tutorial, the name of the inputs will probably need to be set to whatever the corresponding variable
 in the java file(s) controlling this stuff is, with those variables working with java's sql stuff to input data into the correct
 fields in an entry
 
 how to css:
 <style>
        #element1 {
            display: inline-block;
            width: 1000px;
        }
    </style>
